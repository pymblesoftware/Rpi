In these notes "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" means the MAC address of the remote bluetooth device

Reset Bluetooth Adaptor

sudo hciconfig hci0 reset
Restart Bluetooth Service

sudo invoke-rc.d bluetooth restart
List Bluetooth Adaptors

hciconfig
Scan for Bluetooth devices

hcitool scan
To then connect to one of the found devices  you can use this:


sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
Make The Raspberry Pi Discoverable

sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan
You will now be able to search and find the RPi from other devices such as windows "Add A Device" (development tip â€“ if you've previously connected you'll need to remove it from Windows Devices for it to be able to found it again by Add A Device)

To allow the connection to complete you need to also do the following step to allow a remote device to actually connect:


sudo bluetooth-agent 1234
1234 is the pairing code for it to use, but this will can be automatically overridden by a randomly selected code displayed on both devices

Discover Bluetooth Devices

hcitool scan
List Previously Paired Devices

bluez-test-device list
(This will appear to do nothing if there are no devices).

Remove Previously Paired Device
You will need to get the devices MAC address by using the List command

If you need to disconnect it first:


bluez-test-device disconnect xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
Then


bluez-test-device remove xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
Ping Device

sudo l2ping -c 1 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx





Once you have your RPi paired with another device you have a Bluetooth link, but you still need to set up another protocol over the Bluetooth called "RFCOMM" to provide an emulated serial connection between the two devices.

Setting The RPi to create a serial connection to a Bluetooth device at startup
Enter the command:


sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf
Add the connection details:


rfcomm1 {
    # Automatically bind the device at startup
    bind yes;

   # Bluetooth address of the device
    device xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;

    # RFCOMM channel for the connection
    channel 1;

    # Description of the connection
    comment "My Bluetooth Connection";
}
